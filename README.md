# 🎯 Career Roadmap – [JeffreyHill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-hill-57b67411a/) [ChromeStorms](https://discord.gg/rnsKBCaNfD)

Welcome! This README outlines my personal career goals and long-term development plan. As a developer focused on immersive experiences, defense simulation tools, and AI-enhanced XR design, this document serves as both a roadmap and accountability tool. It combines SMART goal planning and a forward-looking career strategy map. This was made as part of my Full Sail coursework.  I decided to make it a public file in case anyone would like to use it as a template.

## 🧠 SMART Career Goals

### 🎯 Short-Term Goal (0–1 Year)
**Goal:**  
To fully rebuild and enhance my SCP vending machine game in Unreal Engine, with a playable prototype and foundational systems, and present it as part of my graduation portfolio by the end of this academic year.

**Steps:**  
- Recreate all core vending, interaction, and cursed item systems from Python into Unreal Blueprints or C++.  
- Implement at least one SCP-inspired room with animated vending logic and cinematic triggers.  
- Publish a development demo or video walkthrough on [Itch.io](https://itch.io) and link it to my GitHub and portfolio.

---

### 🧭 Mid-Term Goal (1–3 Years)
**Goal:**  
To release a playable Monitor Tank game in Unity for desktop and mobile while prototyping AR/VR overlays and AI integration using YOLO, and prepare for applications to Anduril or VR-focused studios.

**Steps:**  
- Finish and polish the desktop version of the Monitor Tank game in Unity, including UI, effects, and upgrades.  
- Port the game to mobile with intuitive touch controls and performance optimizations.  
- Develop a prototype of an AR interface overlay using YOLO object detection and display it in a headset-based or simulated drone view.  
- Attend industry events or apply for internships with Anduril or similar companies focused on defense tech or spatial computing.

---

### 🚀 Long-Term Goal (5–10 Years)
**Goal:**  
To work as a technical or XR engineer at a cutting-edge VR/AR company like **Anduril**, or launch my own **indie studio** focused on immersive simulation, defense interfaces, and AI-assisted gameplay systems.

**Steps:**  
- Gain 3–5 years of experience shipping games or immersive tech in Unity/Unreal (including VR or AR pipelines).  
- Build and release one commercial product (either solo or with a team) via Steam or mobile app stores.  
- Network and collaborate with artists, AI researchers, and defense-tech mentors to secure partnerships or investors.  
- Establish a small studio, brand identity, and demo reel focused on tactical games and interface innovation.
